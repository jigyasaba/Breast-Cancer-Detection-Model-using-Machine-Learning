Ahoy Techies,This is my first project that I have uploaded on GitHub.
# Breast-Cancer-Detection-Model-using-Machine-Learning
This Project involves Early Detection and Monitoring System for Breast Cancer Patients using Machine Learning Models
## Overview
Breast cancer is the type of cancer that most commonly affects women. The majority of Indian women who are diagnosed with breast cancer have a 50% chance of survival which means the mortality rate is high  compared to the survival rate. Globally, Breast cancer is now the most common cancer diagnosed, surpassing lung cancer. Survival for breast cancer among women diagnosed between 2010 and 2014 varies greatly with changes in location. It is the most prevalent form of cancer and the leading global cause of fatalities for women. It is a widespread problem and not a geographical problem In the majority of places, it is generally recognised to be greater than fifty percent. Although there is no identified treatment method to prevent breast cancer, chances of survival can be significantly increased by early identification and diagnosis. This preliminary model compares the widely used machine learning algorithms and techniques, such as Random Forest, KNN, SVM, Decision Tree, and Logistic Regression, which are frequently used to predict breast cancer. 
### The ensemble method  has also been  employed, which is a technique that integrates numerous models rather than utilizing just one to improve the accuracy of outcomes in models. In the Ensemble technique, the Bagging method is utilized to improve model accuracy through decision trees, which significantly reduces variance.
Don't get too overwhelmed you will understand as you will dive further into the project.
